% Question 1

\section{Q1}
Question: An Airplane is monitored at the location illustrated below with
respect to the airport, find the directional angles of the plane.
\\

Solution:

We know that the coordinates of the planes is $5$ units $South$, $7$ units
$East$, and $4$ units $Up$.

Let $South, East\text{, and }Up$ be represented by the Cartesian Coordinates
$x, y\text{, and }z$, respectively.

Let $\alpha, \beta \text{, and } \gamma$ be the angles between the plane and the
axes $South, East\text{, and } Up$, respectively.

\begin{align}
    \alpha = \cos^{-1}{\frac{}{}}
\end{align}
