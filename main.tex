\section{Introduction}

% I hope the instructor allows us to use LaTeX, I really don't want to write
% this shit out.

These are my solutions to the assignment given in the course ES202.

\subsection{AI Policy of This Paper}
Large-Language-Model's (LLM) are only used in the formatting of this file. At no
point, LLM's are used to solve the questions in the assignment, unlike other
students taking the course who like to ask the help of LLMs even during the
examinations. The reason this is written in LaTeX rather than by hand, is only
because I have no time to do it by hand, and wanted to improve my LaTeX skills.
The git commit history can be found in the GitHub repository \\

also as a proof of the fact that this entire document was written by hand.

% Question 1

\section{Question 1}
\textbf{Problem}
An airplane is monitored at coordinates $(5, 7, 4)$ relative to the airport
(South, East, Up). Find the directional angles of the plane.
\\
\\
\textbf{Solution:}
Let the position vector of the plane be $\vec{r}$. We define the axes such that
$x=\text{South}$, $y=\text{East}$, and $z=\text{Up}$.

\begin{align*}
	% define the vector of the airplane
	\vec{r}        & = 5\hat{i} + 7\hat{j} + 4\hat{k} \\
	\norm{\vec{r}} & = \sqrt{5^{2} + 7^{2} + 4^{2}}   \\
	               & = \sqrt{25 + 49 + 16}            \\
	               & = \sqrt{90}                      \\
	               & \approx 9.4868                   \\
\end{align*}
The directional angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are given by the direction
cosines:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
	% Row 1: Symbolic Formulas
	\alpha & = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r_x}{\norm{\vec{r}}}\right) \quad &
	\beta  & = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r_y}{\norm{\vec{r}}}\right) \quad &
	\gamma & = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r_z}{\norm{\vec{r}}}\right)         \\
	% Row 2: Numerical Substitution (Empty LHS aligns to the equals sign above)
	       & = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{\sqrt{90}}\right)              &
	       & = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{7}{\sqrt{90}}\right)              &
	       & = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{90}}\right)                \\
	% Row 3: Final Answer
	       & \approx 58.19^\circ                                      &
	       & \approx 42.45^\circ                                      &
	       & \approx 64.06^\circ
\end{alignat*}
